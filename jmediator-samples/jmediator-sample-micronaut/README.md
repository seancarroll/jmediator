Improve this doc
Create an app using the Micronaut Command Line Interface.

mn create-app example.micronaut.complete

The previous command creates a micronaut app with the default package example.micronaut in a folder named complete.

By default, create-app generates a Java Micronaut app and it uses Gradle build system. However, you could use other build tool such as Maven or other programming languages such as Groovy or Kotlin.

If you are using Java or Kotlin and IntelliJ IDEA make sure you have enabled annotation processing.
